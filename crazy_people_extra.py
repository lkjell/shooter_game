"""
Write a program that generates two random numbers between 0 and 9.

1. When the program starts, a 400x400 window appears. The title of the window is "Lottery".

2. There should be widgets in the program window:
- the label "Click to participate",
- two blanks for numbers "?"
- A "Try your luck" button.

3. After pressing the button:
- the first label should change to â€œYou win! Play again" (the numbers are the same) or "You lose! Play again" (the numbers are not equal),
- numbers from 0 to 9 should appear in place of the blanks.

The program should work until the user clicks on the red x.
